  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)    

## Description
This budget tracking application will allow a user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. This app is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) utilizing techniques such as manifests, service workers, and file cache/fetching.
<br/>
<br/>
My motivation for this project was to try my hand at a PWA and create something that a user could still interact with even when offline.
<br/>
<br/>
I built this project the help myself understand technologies like indexedDB, service workers, manifests, and offline file caching/fetching. This PWA offered me the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge and implement newly learned leasons. 
<br/>
<br/>
This app will solve a user's problem of not being able to interact with the application unless they are connected to the internet. With this app the user will still be able to maintain their access with or without internet connection.
<br/>
<br/>
While building this app I learned what was required to keep an app functional without a connection. PWAs require access all the time, even without service/internet connect. I learned about indexedDB, which will temporarily store a user's data locally until it can access a database once back online. I learned that service workers help cache and fetch the data needed to maintain an app when connection is lost.
